Who Let the Dogs Out?
Baha Men

[Hook]
Who let the dogs out?
(Who, who, who, who)
Who let the dogs out?
(Who, who, who, who)
Who let the dogs out?
(Who, who, who, who)
Who let the dogs out?
(Who, who, who, who)

[Verse 1]
Well the party was nice, the party was pumpin' (Hey, Yippie-Yi-Yo)
And everybody havin' a ball (Hah, ho, Yippie-Yi-Yo)
Until the fellas started name callin' (Yippie-Yi-Yo)
And the girls respond to the call
I heard a woman shout out

[Hook]
"Who let the dogs out?"
(Who, who, who, who)
Who let the dogs out?
(Who, who, who, who)
Who let the dogs out?
(Who, who, who, who)
Who let the dogs out?
(Who, who, who, who)

[Bridge]
I see ya' little speedboat head up our coast
She really want to skip town
Get back gruffy, back scruffy
Get back you flea-infested mongrel!

[Verse 2]
Gonna tell myself, "Hey man no get angry" (Hey, Yippie, Yi, Yo)
To any girls calling them canine, hey! (Yippie, Yi, Yo)
But they tell me "Hey Man, It's part of the Party!" (Yippie Yi, Yo)
You put a woman in front and her man behind (Yippie, Yi, Yo)
I heard a woman shout out

[Hook]
Who let the dogs out?
(Who, who, who, who)
Who let the dogs out?
(Who, who, who, who)
Who let the dogs out?
(Who, who, who, who)
Who let the dogs out?
(Who, who, who, who)

[Bridge 2]
Say, A doggy is nuttin' if he don't have a bone!
(Oh doggy hold ya' bone, oh doggy hold it)
A doggy is nuttin' if he don't have a bone!
(Oh doggy hold ya' bone, oh doggy hold it)
